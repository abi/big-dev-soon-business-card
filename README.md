# Task
Create your own Business Card Website with HTML and CSS as presented in the design under the Business Card project section in BigDevSoon. Dive into Frontend development and produce a very first, yet beautiful website that could serve as your professional Developer's Portfolio! ðŸ¤—

## Prerequisites
You can choose any technologies of your own preference, the same applies to any tools, libraries, frameworks and everything related. We want you to have fun building this project and composing a technology stack that plays well with your taste.

## Requirements

- [ ] The website looks similar to the design and is implemented as a Desktop version only.
- [ ] Icons should be clickable with a hover effect and redirect users to external pages in a new tab.
- [ ] Users can hover over and click on the email and it'll have the proper `mailto` link.
- [ ] Users can hover over and click on the phone and it'll have the proper `tel` link.
- [ ] Add animations, we recommend a Fade In when the website is loaded and a skeleton animation for loading the user's image.

## Deployment
Once you are ready with the project and unlocked the Complete step, you can try deploying the project to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. One important thing to remember is that we've added a `<bds />` tag to the `index.html` file and will do a check against it while trying to add a Project URL. Don't forget it! ðŸ˜Š
